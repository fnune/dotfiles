# This file will be generated by a script in .zsh/includes/regolith-i3-defaults
# Since Regolith only allows overriding some i3 config using Xresources and
# overriding more settings must happen through a user-defined i3 config, we
# concatenate Regolith's default i3 config with our small set of additional
# settings in .config/regolith/i3/config.overrides
